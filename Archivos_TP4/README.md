This report is about the designing of an ADC/DAC which convert an analogic signal to storage it on a RAM memory. Then, we convert the digital information to show it on a oscilloscope.
The main idea is to evaluate our understanding of RAM memory and how we condition a signal according to the use we want to give it.
